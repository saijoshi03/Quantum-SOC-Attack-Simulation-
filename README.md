# ⚛ Quantum SOC Attack Simulation

### 🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates how a Security Operations Center (SOC) could evolve to detect **quantum-era threats**.  
It integrates **Qiskit (quantum computing)** and **Flask (SOC dashboard)** to visualize real-time simulated logs and alerts.

### ⚙️ Features
- Quantum Random Bit Generation (Qiskit)
- BB84 Quantum Key Distribution simulation
- Grover’s Algorithm attack simulation
- Flask-based real-time dashboard with alerts
- Ethical and controlled attack environment
